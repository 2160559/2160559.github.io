More information
We live here; we are happy to share our home with guests. We have 3 dogs living with us; we do not cage it or tie it so it is free to roam around the garden and the house.
Please respect the rules when in our home.
We do not do laundry, but we can have the guests' laundry picked up by a local laundry service.
Check-in is strictly between 11am and 5pm. 
We ask the guests to always close the gate, so our dog cannot go out onto the street.
We sleep early, so we have a 10pm curfew. For security we lock the main door of the house at exactly 10pm; therefore guests staying in the loft cannot access the suite if they have friends or family staying there. The front door will remained locked from 10pm till 7am the next day. NO EXTENSION on the curfew; we appreciate your courtesy for abiding to our rules.
No smoking indoors!
No noise after 10pm!
FYI: we have another room available in Le Coq Bleu(suite) as well as 4 more rooms in Le Coq Floral.
