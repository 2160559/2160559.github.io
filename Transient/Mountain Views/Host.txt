Hi. I'm Lex, a Canadian expat now living in Baguio after having travelled in Europe, Americas and South-East Asia. I fell in-love with Baguio 3 years ago because of its climate, small town feel but big city amenities, and importantly its proximity to beaches. I'm quite open and generous with stories so feel free to ask about the nooks of this city.
