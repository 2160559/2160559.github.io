Friendly and very hospitable and accommodating family of 6 and granddaughter Juliana. We love Baguio City due to the location. The environemnt is peaceful, the climate is perfect, and quiet; very much like living in the USA. Being a host, we like to have guests feel safe and to be in a convienent location. We want you to enjoy your time and feel at home and especially the environment around Baguio City. If you prefer a condo unit, search Ortega Goshen/NC Condo which is available as well; please feel free to share us with your family and friends for their next vacation. HAVE A NICE DAY AND ENJOY!
