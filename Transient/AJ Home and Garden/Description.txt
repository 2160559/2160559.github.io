AJ Home and Garden is located in a gated family compound. The interior is a combination of concrete and mostly wood paneling including pinewood. At night, the paper moon lantern makes a beautiful reflection on the picture windows in the dining, and in the lounge area. Guests may enjoy viewing a part of the city and sunrise, from the garden. We are within walking distance to Petron Gasoline Station at Marcos Highway Junction, satellite markets, sari sari stores and canteen.
